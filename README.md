# WDI First Project 

For the first project you will use your knowledge of front and back-end web development to produce an awesome web application that can be used by friends, family or any of the other billions of people who use the Internet. The type of web application you create is your choice.

The objective of this project is to:
* To apply knowledge by building a web application from the ground up.
* To demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course.
* Showcase your abilities to potential employers, friends, family, and community members.


## CORE REQUIREMENTS
* **Models.** Your app should have at least 3 models. Make sure they are associated correctly!
* **Views.** Use partials to DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) up your views.
* **Front-end Framework.** A CSS framework like Twitter Bootstrap, Foundation or similar to kick start your front-end.
* **Handles invalid data.** Forms in your application should validate data and handle incorrect inputs. Validate sign up information, verify valid email addresses and secure passwords.
* **External APIs.** Use an external API to add functionality to your app.
* **User Login.** Make sure you have authentication and authorization set up.
* **Heroku.** Deploy your code to Heroku.

## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES

Thursday Night deliverables (concept):
* **Concept** What is your concept? What are the objects that the models represent?
* **Scope.** What features will it have? What do you reasonably think you can implement in the time period? Don't overdo it. Keep it simple.

Weekend deliverables (plan):
* **Wireframes.** Sketch out on paper or digitally what a few of your core pages will look like and how they will work. Put these in Github.
* **Object Models** Draw out the model associations for your project on paper or digitally. Put these in Github. 
* **Milestones.** Outline some daily milestones for yourself based on how you prefer to work.

Final project deliverables:
* Link to Heroku hosted project
* Link to source code on GitHub


## TIMELINE

## WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR
Make sure that your code is:
* Dynamic
* Flexible/extensible
* Well-commented
* Well-formatted
* Follows naming conventions

We’ll also be looking at:
* Quality of communication around decision-making. Can you defend why you chose a certain technology or why you implemented your solution in a certain way?
